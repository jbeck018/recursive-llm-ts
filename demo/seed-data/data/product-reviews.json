    "body": "We migrated from a custom Grafana setup to Acme Pro and the difference is night and day. Real-time dashboards load in under a second, the drag-and-drop builder saved our team weeks of work, and the funnel analysis feature alone justified the cost. Our product team now self-serves 90% of their analytics needs without bothering engineering. The API is clean and well-documented. Only minor complaint is that CSV exports for large datasets can be slow.",

    "body": "The event ingestion API handles our 500K events/minute without breaking a sweat. Schema validation catches malformed events before they pollute our data, which is a huge win. Rate limiting is fair and well-communicated. The SDKs for Python and TypeScript are solid. I took off one star because the documentation for custom event schemas could be more detailed - we spent two days figuring out how to set up nested property validation. Also, the error messages for schema violations could be more specific about which field failed.",

    "body": "The platform is undeniably powerful. ClickHouse-backed queries are blazing fast and the Flink-based stream processing is impressive. However, the learning curve for advanced features is quite steep. It took our team three weeks to properly set up custom funnels with filtered cohorts. The SQL query interface is nice but lacks syntax highlighting and autocomplete. I'd also like to see better support for statistical functions - we still need to export data to Python for significance testing. The support team is responsive though, typically replying within 4 hours.",

The role-based access control means I can give our marketing team dashboard access without worrying about them breaking anything. The alerting system with PagerDuty integration has caught two critical issues before they impacted customers. WebSocket-powered real-time updates mean our ops team always has a current picture. Worth every penny of the Enterprise plan.",

    "body": "The ingestion API itself works fine - reliable, fast, handles bursts well. But the operational visibility is lacking. When we had a brief outage last month, the status page didn't update for 45 minutes. The Prometheus metrics endpoint doesn't expose enough detail to build proper monitoring. We can't see per-topic Kafka lag, which makes it hard to tell if our events are being processed or stuck. Also, the Go SDK is significantly behind the TypeScript and Python SDKs in feature parity. We had to write custom retry logic that the other SDKs include out of the box.",

Acme won on: (1) raw query performance - sub-second on 500M row tables, (2) the hybrid architecture that doesn't force you into a pure SQL or pure point-and-click paradigm, (3) data residency options for our EU customers. The pricing is competitive for our scale (2B events/month). Areas for improvement: the mobile SDK is basic, A/B testing integration is experimental, and I'd love to see dbt model support for defining metrics as code. Overall very satisfied - renewed our annual contract.",

    "body": "The visualization options are excellent. The heatmap and sankey diagrams are particularly good for user journey analysis. Dashboard load times are consistently fast even with 20+ charts. My team of 8 analysts uses it daily. Where it falls short is collaboration: no commenting on dashboards, no version history for charts, and sharing a dashboard with specific filters applied requires a workaround with URL parameters. The scheduled report emails are useful but the formatting could be improved. Looking forward to the collaboration features on the roadmap.",

Being able to define funnels with arbitrary SQL conditions (not just event sequences) is incredibly powerful. The cohort comparison views helped us identify that users who engage with our onboarding tutorial within the first hour have 3.2x higher 30-day retention. That single insight drove a product change that improved our activation rate by 18%. The real-time funnel updates mean we can see the impact of changes within minutes of deployment.",

During our last Black Friday, we peaked at 4.2M events/minute with zero dropped events and P99 latency stayed under 15ms. The auto-scaling on their end is invisible to us. The batch ingestion endpoint is particularly well-designed - we can send up to 1000 events per request and the response tells us exactly which events (if any) failed validation. Their TypeScript SDK's built-in retry with exponential backoff saved us from writing that boilerplate ourselves.",

    "body": "The query performance is genuinely impressive - ClickHouse under the hood does the heavy lifting well. But the data model is rigid in some frustrating ways. You can't easily join event data with external dimensions (like a product catalog or user profile table). The workaround is to denormalize everything into event properties, which bloats storage and makes schema changes painful. Also, there's no native support for slowly changing dimensions - if a user upgrades their plan, historical events still show the old plan. I've raised these with support and they're 'on the roadmap' but no timeline. If your use case fits the pure event model, it's excellent. If you need relational capabilities, look elsewhere.",
