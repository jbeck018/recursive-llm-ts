SALES CALL TRANSCRIPT
Date: January 15, 2026
Account: TechCorp Industries
Participants: Sarah Johnson (Account Executive), Michael Chen (VP of Engineering, TechCorp)
Duration: 47 minutes

[00:00] Sarah: Hi Michael, thanks for making time today. How have things been going with the platform implementation?

[00:32] Michael: Hey Sarah. Honestly, I wish I could say things are going smoothly, but we've hit some significant roadblocks. The integration with our legacy systems has been far more complex than anticipated.

[01:15] Sarah: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you walk me through what specific challenges you're facing?

[01:28] Michael: Well, for starters, the data migration took twice as long as planned. We had to pull in additional contractors just to keep things moving, which has blown our budget completely out of proportion. Management is not happy about that.

[02:03] Sarah: I understand that's frustrating. Have you been able to work with our implementation team on optimizing the migration process?

[02:15] Michael: We have, but frankly, the response time has been disappointing. It sometimes takes 48 hours to get a response on critical issues. When you're trying to meet aggressive deadlines, that's simply not acceptable.

[02:47] Sarah: That's concerning to hear, and I apologize for that. Let me escalate this with our support team lead immediately. You should be getting same-day responses for critical issues.

[03:12] Michael: I appreciate that, Sarah. But there's more. Three weeks ago, Jennifer Martinez, who was our main point of contact on your technical team, left the company. We weren't notified until a week later, and by then we'd lost significant progress on our custom API integrations.

[03:45] Sarah: I'm really sorry about that transition. Jennifer's departure was sudden, but we should have communicated that to you immediately. Who's been assigned to your account now?

[04:02] Michael: Someone named David Park reached out, but he's still getting up to speed on our requirements. It feels like we're starting from scratch again.

[04:20] Sarah: I'll make sure David gets a comprehensive handoff document and I'll personally brief him on your account's history. We can schedule a deep-dive session this week if that would help?

[04:38] Michael: That would be helpful, yes. Look, Sarah, I need to be direct with you. Our CFO is questioning whether we should continue with this platform. She's been looking at competitors, particularly CloudScale Solutions, because they have some features we desperately need that you don't currently offer.

[05:15] Sarah: Can you tell me more about which features specifically?

[05:22] Michael: The real-time analytics dashboard and the automated compliance reporting. These are critical for our industry, and CloudScale has both out of the box. With you guys, we'd have to build custom solutions, which means more time and money we don't have.

[06:01] Sarah: I understand. I know our product team has been working on enhanced analytics capabilities. Let me check on the timeline for those features and see if we can accelerate access for key accounts like yours.

[06:25] Michael: Sarah, I appreciate your willingness to help, but timeline promises don't help us right now. We need solutions today, not in six months.

[06:42] Sarah: You're absolutely right. Let me propose something different. What if we brought in our professional services team to build those custom integrations at a reduced rate? We could also look at crediting some of the overages from your implementation delays.

[07:15] Michael: That's... actually more reasonable than I expected. What kind of timeline and cost are we talking about?

[07:28] Sarah: I'd need to get you specific numbers, but I'm thinking we could have the analytics dashboard custom-built within 6-8 weeks, and I'm confident I can get approval for at least a 40% discount on those services. Plus, I'll work with our finance team on a credit for the implementation delays.

[08:05] Michael: Okay, that's starting to sound more promising. But I need this in writing by end of week, Sarah. The CFO is meeting with CloudScale next Tuesday, and if I don't have a concrete proposal from you by then, I'm concerned we might be switching platforms.

[08:30] Sarah: I completely understand. You'll have a detailed proposal with pricing by Thursday afternoon. I'll also include a revised support SLA that guarantees 4-hour response times for critical issues.

[08:52] Michael: Alright, that sounds fair. I do want to say, Sarah, despite all these challenges, you've been responsive and honest with us. That counts for something. The platform itself is solid when it works; it's really the implementation and support experience that's been the issue.

[09:20] Sarah: I genuinely appreciate you saying that, Michael, and I take full responsibility for where we've fallen short. You've been a good partner to us, and we need to be better partners to you.

[09:41] Michael: I agree. Look, I'm cautiously optimistic that we can work this out. The team here actually likes the platform's core functionality. It's everything around it that's been problematic.

[10:05] Sarah: That's really valuable feedback. Beyond the immediate proposal, I'd like to set up bi-weekly check-ins with you and your team for the next quarter. No sales pitch, just ensuring we're meeting your needs and addressing issues proactively.

[10:28] Michael: That would be good. We should also include someone from your product team in at least some of those calls. We have a lot of feature requests and industry-specific needs that might be valuable for your roadmap.

[10:47] Sarah: Absolutely. I'll make sure our VP of Product joins us. Your input could really help shape what we build next.

[11:08] Michael: Okay, Sarah. Send me that proposal by Thursday, and let's schedule a call with David Park for next Monday to get him fully briefed on our account.

[11:25] Sarah: Will do. I'll send you both a calendar invite and the proposal document. Thank you for being direct with me today, Michael. It helps me understand how to better support you.

[11:41] Michael: Thanks for listening, Sarah. I'm hoping we can turn this around. Talk to you soon.

[11:48] Sarah: Absolutely. Talk soon, Michael.

CUSTOMER SUCCESS CHECK-IN
Date: January 20, 2026  
Account: DataFlow Analytics
Participants: Jessica Lee (Customer Success Manager), Robert Williams (CTO, DataFlow)

[00:00] Jessica: Hi Robert! Great to connect with you today. How's everything going with the platform?

[00:15] Robert: Hey Jessica! Things are actually going pretty well. The team has really gotten comfortable with the system over the past month.

[00:28] Jessica: That's wonderful to hear! Have you been able to explore any of the advanced features we discussed last time?

[00:40] Robert: We have, actually. The custom reporting dashboards have been a game-changer for us. Our data team loves them. We're processing about 40% more data insights per week now compared to our old solution.

[01:05] Jessica: That's fantastic! I love hearing success stories like that. Are there any areas where you'd like additional training or support?

[01:20] Robert: Honestly, we're in a pretty good place. The documentation has been thorough, and whenever we've had questions, your support team has been really responsive. Usually get answers within a few hours.

[01:42] Jessica: That's great feedback. I'll make sure to pass that along to the team. How's the integration with your data warehouse going?

[01:55] Robert: Smooth as butter. No issues there. We did have one minor hiccup with authentication last week, but your support team resolved it in about 30 minutes.

[02:15] Jessica: Excellent. I'm glad we could help quickly. On another note, I wanted to mention that we're rolling out some new machine learning features next month that might be perfect for your use case.

[02:35] Robert: Oh really? What kind of features?

[02:40] Jessica: Predictive analytics and anomaly detection. Based on your data patterns, the system can automatically flag unusual trends and forecast future patterns.

[03:00] Robert: That sounds really interesting. Can you send me some documentation on that? I'd love to review it with the team.

[03:12] Jessica: Absolutely. I'll email you a preview guide this afternoon. We're also offering early access to beta customers if you're interested in testing it before the full release.

[03:30] Robert: Yeah, we'd definitely be interested in that. We're always looking for ways to add more value to our clients.

[03:45] Jessica: Perfect. I'll get you set up. Is there anything else you need from us right now?

[03:55] Robert: Not that I can think of. Things are running smoothly. Actually, we were just talking about expanding our usage to include our European operations. What would that look like from a licensing perspective?

[04:18] Jessica: Great question. Let me connect you with our enterprise sales team. They can walk you through the options and pricing. It should be pretty straightforward since you're already a customer.

[04:38] Robert: Sounds good. And Jessica, I just want to say, the partnership with your team has been excellent. You guys have been proactive, responsive, and the platform delivers on what was promised. That's rare.

[05:00] Jessica: Thank you so much, Robert! That really means a lot. We're fortunate to have customers like you who are engaged and give us great feedback.

[05:15] Robert: Well, keep doing what you're doing. Looking forward to exploring those new ML features.

[05:25] Jessica: Awesome. I'll send over that documentation today, and let's reconnect in two weeks?

[05:35] Robert: Perfect. Talk to you then!
